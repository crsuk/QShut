# QShut
**Welcome to the QShut GitHub Page!**


There's honestly not much to describe about this project. It was something I made in
my spare time, and I wanted to share it! It was made to save me visiting to console every time I wanted to schedule a shutdown.


## Preview

At the moment I haven't got any pictures, but there will eventually be some on here.


## Getting Started

If you'd simply like the program, it is located in the **Bin** folder. If you'd like the Source,
the entire solution is contained in the **Source** folder.


## Things?

As far as I know this should work on most versions of Windows. I came across something about
the command can be a little different between major Windows versions but I've not looked into it too much.


## Other

I'm more than happy to answer any questions, and I do have a few other projects in the early stages. This is my first use of GitHub, so go easy on me!
And if you would like to buy me a cup of coffee, I'd be very grateful!

**Oh and P.S**,
Have a good day!
